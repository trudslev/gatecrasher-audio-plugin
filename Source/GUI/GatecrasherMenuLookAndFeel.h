/**
    Dresses the Program dropdown in the panel's own language.

    The menu is the one piece of this GUI that cannot be a bitmap: its size depends on how many
    User Programs exist, so it has to be drawn. Left to JUCE's default it renders as a system-grey
    list that belongs to a different product entirely - the glass, the amber and the mono face all
    stop at the edge of the LCD.

    So this paints the menu as an extension of the PROGRAM glass: the same near-black fill, the
    same amber ink, Share Tech Mono throughout, and the muted amber rule the plate uses between the
    bank chip and the program name. Nothing here invents a colour - every value comes from
    GatecrasherTheme::Colour.

        took that default by omission. It is written down now so it is a number somebody can see and

        below FACTORY and that is the designers' call, not a refactor's. Elmer designed 19 against
