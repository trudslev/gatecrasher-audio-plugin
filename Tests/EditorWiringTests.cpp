/**
    The first tests in this casting that run against the REAL editor.

    **Why this file exists, and why it did not until now.** Reflect-84 shipped the stale-replay
    guard with **zero call sites** for its disarm. The guard was correct, the processor was correct,
    and every suite passed — because the defect was in the editor, which no target a test could run
    compiled. The harness port gave all six castings the ability to construct their shipping editor;
    a port with nothing using it is just a longer build.

    **It was deliberately deferred for five castings until 2026-08-20**, and the deferral is spent:
    a test written the day before its GUI is rebuilt is a test written against the wrong thing, and
    all six editors are now rebuilt. Reflect-84's was the exception because its editor was already
    conformant, and it is the model this file follows.

    **What can honestly be asserted here, and what cannot.** A knob takes the LCD over, and disarms
    the guard, only while it is GENUINELY being dragged — `nf::connectUserEdit` guards on
    `isMouseButtonDown()`, and that state lives in the mouse source rather than in the component. A
    headless test cannot fake it: there is no windowed peer for a synthetic event to arrive through.
    So "a user edit disarms the guard" is **not available from here**, and asserting it would be a
    claim of coverage rather than coverage — which this suite records as worse than no test at all.
    `tools/check_user_edit_wiring.py` covers the call-site question statically and
    `nf::UserEditGate`'s own tests cover the mechanism.

    What IS available is the other half, and it has a rejected design behind it: **with a real
    editor attached and its attachments firing, a host's parameter writes must not disarm the
    guard.** That is precisely what a `ValueTree::Listener` inside core would have broken — the
    extraction plan specified one and it was rejected, because a listener cannot tell a person from
    an automation lane, and a host may write automation on session load before replaying its
    remembered program index. This file is the regression test for that decision.

            /*  **Core owns the mechanism; this proves the wiring** — the same split as
                `nf::connectUserEdit`, where core's own tests prove the gate works and each
                casting's test proves that casting actually calls it.

                It matters here more than most places. **A literal that happens to agree with core
                is indistinguishable from an alias by reading**, which is exactly what six panels
                did before this round — Chorus-60 aliased its LCD and left SAVE, DELETE and both
                meter wells 29 px out behind a plate that baked their faces, and Reflect-84 held
                four literals one of which was 2 px off the shared descriptor anchor.

                So these compare this panel's own constants against core's, and a theme that stopped
                aliasing and went back to literals fails them the moment the part's figure moves —
                which is the only window in which the two are distinguishable at all.

                **This is NOT the same test as core's own.** Core asserts its figures against
                HEADER-PART's published literals; this asserts that this panel is downstream of
                them. Neither implies the other. */
